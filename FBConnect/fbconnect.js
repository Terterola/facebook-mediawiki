/**
 * fbconnect.js and fbconnect-min.js
 * 
 * FBConnect relies on several different libraries and frameworks for its JavaScript
 * code. Each framework has its own method to verify that the propper code won't be
 * called before it's ready. (Below, lambda represents a named or anonymous function.)
 * 
 * MediaWiki:             addOnloadHook(lambda);
 *     This function manages an array of window.onLoad event handlers to be called
 *     be called by a MediaWiki script when the window is fully loaded. Because the
 *     DOM may be ready before the window (due to large images to be downloaded) a
 *     faster alternative is JQuery's document-ready function.
 * 
 * FaceBook Connect SDK:  window.fbAsyncInit = lambda;
 *     This global variable is called when the Facebook Connect SDK is fully
 *     initialized asynchronously to the document's state. This might be long
 *     after the document is finished rendering the first time the script is
 *     downloaded. Subsequently, it may even be called before the DOM is ready.
 * 
 * JQuery:                $(document).ready(lambda);
 *     Self-explanatory -- to be called when the DOM is ready to be manipulated.
 *     Typically this should occur sooner than MediaWiki's addOnloadHook function
 *     is called.

 * After the Facebook Connect JavaScript SDK has been asynchronously loaded,
